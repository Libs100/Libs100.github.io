Hi all! 

My name is Libi and I'm M.Sc. student at [Amnon Bar Shir's lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/Organic_Chemistry/Bar-Shir/home) at Weizmann institute, Rehovot. Israel. 

My goal is to be part of a big start-up that will do a big change in the Biology's world.

I live in Rehovot. 
I love hiking and dancing and to play on my guitar and piano.

## Academic background
I did  my B.Sc. in Biotechnology, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.
During my undergraduate studies, I participated in several research projects:

1. Shohat-Ophir Lab: Investigated motivation encoding in Drosophila, focusing on genetic programs in neurons and their effects on physiology, circuits, and behavior.

2. Haim Cohen Lab: Studied aging mechanisms, with a focus on SIRT6, a regulator of longevity. The research involved human tissue cultures, mouse models, and multi-omics approaches to explore ways to prevent age-related diseases.

3. Gal Yadid Lab: Researched neurotransmitter regulation in animal models of drug abuse and depression, analyzing the effects of psychoactive drugs on biogenic amines, neuropeptides, and related molecular changes.
