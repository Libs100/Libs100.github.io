**Hi all!**

My name is Libi, and I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Life Sciences in [Amnon Bar-Shir's lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/Organic_Chemistry/Bar-Shir/home) at the Weizmann Institute of Science  
My goal is to be part of a major start-up that will bring significant change to the field of biology.

I live in Rehovot.  
I love hiking, dancing, and playing guitar and piano.

## Academic background
I completed my B.Sc. in Biotechnology at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in several research projects:

1. **Shohat-Ophir Lab**: Investigated motivation encoding in Drosophila, focusing on genetic programs in neurons and their effects on physiology, circuits, and behavior.

2. **Haim Cohen Lab**: Studied aging mechanisms, with a focus on SIRT6, a regulator of longevity. The research involved human tissue cultures, mouse models, and multi-omics approaches to explore ways to prevent age-related diseases.

3. **Gal Yadid Lab**: Researched neurotransmitter regulation in animal models of drug abuse and depression, analyzing the effects of psychoactive drugs on biogenic amines, neuropeptides, and related molecular changes.

## Rotations at the Weizmann Institute


1. **[Ayelet Erez Lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/dept/irb/Erez/ayelet-erez-lab)**:  
   Investigates metabolic pathways linked to disease, focusing on urea cycle enzymes and intermediates as regulatory hubs in cellular processes. The lab employs both in vitro and in vivo tools, including GC/MS and HPLC, to monitor metabolic shifts.

2. **[Naama Barkai Lab](https://barkailab.wixsite.com/barkai)**:  
   Examines mechanisms of gene regulation, emphasizing the role of Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDRs) in transcription factors. The research aims to decode how IDRs enable precise and rapid gene targeting within complex genomes.
