    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Life Sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science, specializing in molecular and cellular biology. I am in the second year of my studies.</p>
    <p>My research is conducted in the <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/Organic_Chemistry/Bar-Shir/home" target="_blank">Amnon Bar-Shir Lab</a>, where we focus on advancing the development of innovative biosensors and tracers for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications. By utilizing synthetic chemistry and molecular biology techniques, our lab aims to enable real-time, non-invasive investigation of complex biological processes within deep tissues. These advancements hold promise for providing critical insights into previously inaccessible biological events.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dancing</li>
        <li>Nature hiking</li>
        <li>Music</li>
        <li>Horseback riding</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Academic Background</h2>
    <p>I hold a B.Sc. in Biotechnology from Bar-Ilan University, where I completed a research project focused on aging mechanisms, specifically investigating the role of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) in cellular longevity. This project was conducted in the <a href="https://www.haimcohenlab.com/" target="_blank">lab of Prof. Haim Cohen</a>, a leading research group in the field of molecular aging.</p>
